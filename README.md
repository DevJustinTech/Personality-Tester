# Personality Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to classify individuals as Introverts or Extroverts based on their social behavior data.

## Datasets

The project uses the following CSV files:

*   `train.csv`: The training data, containing features and the target variable (`Personality`).
*   `test.csv`: The test data, containing the same features as the training data, but without the target variable.
*   `sample_submission.csv`: An example of the required submission format.
*   `lgbm_predictions.csv`: The final predictions generated by the model.

### Features

The following features are used to predict the personality type:

*   `Time_spent_Alone`
*   `Stage_fear`
*   `Social_event_attendance`
*   `Going_outside`
*   `Drained_after_socializing`
*   `Friends_circle_size`
*   `Post_frequency`

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

*   `pandas`
*   `numpy`
*   `matplotlib`
*   `scikit-learn`
*   `imblearn`
*   `lightgbm`
*   `lazypredict`

## Usage

To run the project and generate the predictions, execute the cells in the `pgg.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## Modeling

The machine learning pipeline consists of the following steps:

1.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   Missing values in numerical columns are imputed using the mean.
    *   Missing values in categorical columns are imputed using the most frequent value.
    *   Categorical features are converted to numerical format using one-hot encoding.
    *   Features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.
2.  **Handling Class Imbalance:** The `SMOTE` (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is used to address the class imbalance in the training data.
3.  **Model Selection:** `lazypredict` is used to evaluate a variety of classifiers, with `LGBMClassifier` being identified as the top-performing model.
4.  **Prediction:** The trained `LGBMClassifier` is used to make predictions on the test set.

## Output

The final predictions on the test data are saved to the `lgbm_predictions.csv` file. This file contains the `id` of each test sample and the corresponding predicted `Personality` (Introvert or Extrovert).
